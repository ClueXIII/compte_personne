## How do you count the number of people accessing a room, in order to display it to the people in the room, but also to keep statistics over the longer term?

University project as part of the Cursus Master Ing√©nieurie 3 teaching unit

To do this, the project was broken down into two major areas:
- Real-time display for people in the room
- Saving the counter at regular intervals for longer-term statistics.
longer term
Both parts are based on a common foundation: the reading of sensors and the interpretation
of their activation.
